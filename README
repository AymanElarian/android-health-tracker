This app lets you easily and quickly record health metrics like your
blood pressure, what you eat, your weight, and so on. (Well, currently
it only supports those three, but maybe I'll add stuff.)

This is an Android app, and requires the Android SDK: http://developer.android.com/

The author, Dan Morrill, works for Google, but this is not a Google project. It is
purely a personal work.
